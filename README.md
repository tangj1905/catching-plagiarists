# catching-plagiarists
A program that takes in a directory of plaintext files and outputs a list of file pairs along with their number of matches. It serves as a rudimentary way of detecting plagiarism between multiple files.

This was one of my earlier projects, finished in May 2019! There are a few poor programming choices made in this (why is EVERYTHING in one class?!), but I'm still somewhat proud of it nonetheless. It was my first introduction to making GUIs using Swing.

Besides that, this was all made back when I still used BlueJ as my primary IDE.
